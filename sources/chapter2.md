  7. * $x^{\ast}A^{\ast} = \overline{x^{T}A^{T}} = \overline{(Ax)^{T}} =
       (Ax)^{\ast}$

	 * $A^{\ast}Ax = 0$ implies $x^{\ast}A^{\ast}Ax = (Ax)^{\ast}Ax =
       ||Ax||^2 = 0$ which implies $Ax = 0$

	 * Since a solution vector $x$ is a solution of all equations, $A$
       has the same null space as $A^{\ast}A$.
